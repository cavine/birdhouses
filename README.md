# Birdhouses
This simple plugin shows an infobox on the top left of the screen to notify you when your next birdhouse run is available.

Details:

-Time is shown in minutes on the infobox.<br />
-The timer will start a countdown from 50 minutes when you first seed a birdhouse. There is a 5 min grace period before the timer is changed for subequent seeding, as birdhouse runs normally take a minute or two usually.<br />
-The times are stored in a file locally, so it should persist across sessions.<br />
-I tried to code this in such a way that it should track times separately across accounts if you were doing subsequent birdhouse runs on an alt, but I was unable to test it as I dont have one.
